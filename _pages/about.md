I'm Magnus Eriksson, a sociologist based in Berlin and Gothenburg. Currently undertaking a PhD at Lund University, department of [Sociology of Law](http://www.soclaw.lu.se/magnus-eriksson), on the regulation of urban spaces by law and technology. I also have a position at the design research institute [RISE Samhällstransformation](https://www.ri.se/en/magnus-eriksson). My background includes engagement with the politics and cultures of the internet both academically and as part of collectives such as [Piratbyrån](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piratbyr%C3%A5n), [Telecomix ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecomix) and [FATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Art_and_Technology_Lab). Science and Technology Studies, Media Theory, Software Studies and Continental Philosophy also feature in my work.

I also sometimes teach at universities and am part of art exhibitions -- check my [CV](https://cv.blay.se/)

## About here

On this blog I have collected presentations I've done, papers I've written and general thoughts on topics I come across, usually about internet, technology, politics, culture, urbanism.  I'm also quite obsessive with coding and scripting my working environment so I'm also doing posts about code, scripts and computer workflow for academic researchers. 

This blog started in blogspot and went through a wordpress iteration before I became such hipster coder that I run the static web generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I write this blog -- and everything I do; from notes to academic articles -- in the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)  language with [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html) dialect. Usually in [vim](https://github.com/blay/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc) or sublime text. For reference management I use the great free software [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/magnu.se) and tie it together with the Pandoc writing with [Zotxt](https://bitbucket.org/egh/zotxt) and its [Pandoc extension](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandoc-zotxt/0.1.11).
